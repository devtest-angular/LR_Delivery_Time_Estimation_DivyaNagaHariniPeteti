# Linear Regression Delivery Time Prediction Model
This involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Delivery data and making prediction using Linear Regression Model

The objective of this project is to build a regression model that predicts the delivery time for orders placed through Porter. The model will use various features such as the items ordered, the restaurant location, the order protocol, and the availability of delivery partners.

The key goals are:
1. Predict the delivery time for an order based on multiple input features.
2. Improve delivery time predictions to optimise operational efficiency.
3. Understand the key factors influencing delivery time to enhance the model's accuracy.
